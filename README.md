# corruption
A program that databends files into WAV files

Corruption takes any data file as an input and writes a WAV file header to the start of the file, therefore databending a non-sound file into a playable sound file. It is meant for use in databending and sound design.

Corruption is a commandline program and the usage is as follows:
  ./corruption <input_file> <output_filename> <output_folder>
